- First I wrote boilerplate code in HTML
- I used a title tag to give a name for the page
- I use the  div tag to make divisions
- I used the h1 tag to the main heading and h2, h3 for sub-main headings.
- I used the p tag to represent the paragraph
- I used an Embedded link to show Virat Kohli's Twitter and Instagram posts.
- I used an img tag to get the image of Virat Kohli with a source link
- I used iframe tag to get google map and spotify with their source links
