- First I wrote the boilerplate code
- I use the h1 tag for creating the heading 
- I use paragraph tags to write a paragraph
- I use an anchor tag to navigate to another page and I included a href link to where it must navigate
- I use a horizontal row tag to give a horizontal line to differentiate the sections
- I use h2 and h3 sub-heading tags to create subheadings
- I use a division tag to divide the content
- I use unordered list tags and list tags to represent unordered list content
