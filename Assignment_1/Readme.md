# Purpose
First I wrote the boilerplate code.
I use the h1 tag for creating the heading. 
I use paragraph tag(<p></p>) to write a paragraph.
I use anchor tag(<a></a>) to navigate to another page and I included a href link to where it must navigate.
I use a horizontal row tag(<hr>) to give a horizontal line to differentiate the sections.
I use h2 and h3 sub-heading tags to create subheadings.
I use a division tag (<div></div>) to divide the content.
I use unordered list tags (<ul></ul>) and list tags (<li></li> to represent unordered list content.

I use the ordered list tag(<ol></ol> to create an ordered list of content
I use description list tags like <dt></dt>, and <dd></dd> to represent description terms and their descriptions.
I use pre tag (<pre></pre>) to represent the content as pre declared.
